  bio: Asmeret is a soil biogeochemist. Her work focuses on stabilization mechanisms and fate of soil organic matter in systems undergoing change (ex. erosion, fire, and climate change).  Her expertise and perspective expands our understanding of soil processes in systems experiencing natural and/or anthropogenic perturbation in order to understand fundamental principles governed by geomorphology, and contemporary modifications introduced by changes in landuse and climate.
