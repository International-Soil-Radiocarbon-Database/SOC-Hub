# Radiocarbon – the way to tell time in the carbon cycle
Radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) is the radioactive isotope of carbon, with 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Radiocarbon is a cosmogenic radionuclide, which means it is constantly being created by the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere and earth’s surface.  It is unstable, and will spontaneously emit an electron from its nucleus.  The half-life of radiocarbon - the time that it takes for half of the original radiocarbon atoms to revert to <sup>14</sup>N is 5730 years.
